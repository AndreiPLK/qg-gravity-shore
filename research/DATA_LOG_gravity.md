# Research log — gravity direction (extract from the append-only lab log)

## 2026-08-13 — Card A: boundary stable under N=40 -> N=80 doubling
- All 42 boundary cells of the mu0=0 island (allowed cells touching an excluded
  neighbour at N=40) re-tested at unitarity depth n<=80, exact rational arithmetic,
  incremental levels 41..80 only. Result: **0 fell — BOUNDARY STABLE**.
- Island trajectory at 0.1 grid: N=10 664/1369 -> N=20 655 -> N=40 655 -> N=80
  boundary unchanged. The only casualties ever seen: 9 cells, all in column r=-3/5,
  w>=1 (N=10->20). Status: NUMERICALLY_SUPPORTED, grid 0.1, mu0=0, D=4, q=1.
- Artifact: projects/qg-bootstrap/results/boundary_N80_mu0.json
- Ops note: first N=80 attempt died at spawn (exit 127, uv wrapper) with zero log;
  rewritten per compute-runner rules (direct python -u, per-cell progress,
  incremental depth) -> full run ~75 min.

## 2026-08-13 — Author reply received (AInstein audit) + N=2000 re-evaluation
- Dr. Edward Hirst replied (EV-CORR-0001): confirms the search is statistical
  ("sometimes it will converge... sometimes it won't"); reads our seed-124 run as
  approximately Ricci-flat below our threshold; flags 24 hidden points as too few
  (paper standard 2000). No checkpoints offered.
- Response-in-kind: vacuum leg re-running on N=2000 hidden points, all 5 seeds,
  same frozen thresholds (H1/H2 frozen in verifier/vacuum_deep.py BEFORE results).
  Smoke test at N=20 reproduced the 24-point verdicts (123 FAIL / 124 PASS /
  125 FAIL / 126 PASS / 127 FAIL).

## 2026-08-13 — N=2000 vacuum re-evaluation: all five verdicts unchanged
- Hirst's methodological point addressed: hidden test set 24 -> 2000 points
  (paper standard), same frozen thresholds, same evaluator, hidden seeds derived
  from checkpoint sha256. Runtime ~3-5 min/seed.
- seed 123: median 0.9606 FAIL | 124: 0.2223 PASS | 125: 0.3781 FAIL |
  126: 0.1865 PASS | 127: 1.1763 FAIL — identical verdict pattern to the
  24-point run (frozen H1/H2 both confirmed). 2/5 seeds pass the vacuum leg.
- Artifact: projects/ainstein-audit/results/processed/vacuum_deep_N2000.json

## 2026-08-13 — Reply to Hirst SENT (founder pressed Send)
- Content: N=2000 re-evaluation (verdicts unchanged, 2/5 pass), repo+DOI link,
  soft repeat of the checkpoint request. Correspondence continues as EV-CORR-0001.

## 2026-08-13 — ANALYTIC RESULT: the island's left edge is r = -1/2
- Derived in closed form: a_{n,n-1} = K(n)(n(r+1/2)+w)(1+n+r+w)/((2+r)_n(1+r+w)),
  K(n)>0, at mu0=0, D=4, q=1. In the physical domain sign(a_{n,n-1}) =
  sign(n(r+1/2)+w).
- Explains ALL nine N=10->20 casualties exactly (kill level n=10w+1 at r=-3/5,
  matches the measured (n,l) list cell by cell) and why no cell fell afterwards.
- Razor test passed: predicted an exact zero at n=25 for the never-scanned point
  (r,w)=(-13/25,1/2); exact arithmetic confirms a_{24,23}>0, a_{25,24}=0,
  a_{26,25}<0. Plus 60/60 random points.
- Corollary: true left edge of the island at mu0=0 is r=-1/2; finite-N maps
  overstate the sliver (-0.6,-0.5); erosion depth ~ w/|r+1/2|.
- Note: projects/qg-bootstrap/research/left-edge-theorem.md. Independent review
  pending — not promoted beyond "analytic derivation, numerically confirmed".

## 2026-08-13 — Left-edge theorem generalized to arbitrary mu0
- sign(a_{n,n-1}) = sign(n(r+(1+mu0)/2)+w) for n > 3mu0: the island's left edge
  moves as r = -(1+mu0)/2. Razor tests at mu0=+-3/5 passed with exact zeros at
  predicted off-grid points (n=20 and n=15).

## 2026-08-13 — Fine boundary 0.02 + theorem correction + mu0-stack test
- Fine scan (84 boundary squares, 2411 points, NMAX=20 exact): 1321 allowed raw.
- Theorem post-processing removed 176 false positives (r<-1/2 cells doomed at
  n>20) -> 1145/2411 allowed. Artifact: fine_boundary_mu0_N20_corrected.json.
- mu0-stack left edges vs theorem -(1+mu0)/2: EXACT match for mu0 = -9/5, -6/5,
  -3/5, 0 (predicted -0.20/-0.10.../-0.50 all observed). For mu0 > 0 the island
  is cut tighter than the theorem line -> a_{n,n-1} is not the binding
  constraint there; next suspect a_{n,n-2}. Theorem is one-sided (outer bound),
  so no contradiction.
- Visual: article/visuals/qg-island-edge-theorem.png (Relic style, real data).

## 2026-08-13 — a_{n,n-2} closed form + COMPLETE analytic characterization (mu0=0)
- Third trajectory: sign(a_{n,n-2}) = sign[12(2n-1)(1+r)(nr+2w)+n(n^2+5n-2)] —
  kills only in a finite n-window (cubic term wins asymptotically). Verified vs
  brute force n=3..8 (positive constant ratios).
- Killer census over all 714 excluded cells: every binding constraint is either
  n<=5 (explicit curves, e.g. a_{2,0}: 3(1+r)(r+w)+1>=0) or the l=n-1 ladder.
- COMPLETE CHARACTERIZATION TEST: analytic island (n<=5 curves + ladder + domain)
  vs scans: 1369/1369 coarse (N=40, boundary stable to 80) and 2411/2411 fine
  (0.02, theorem-corrected) — ZERO mismatches on 3780 exact points.
- Status: conjecturally complete (n>5, l<=n-2 non-binding proven empirically to
  depth 80); independent domain-critic review pending.

## 2026-08-13 — mu0>0 solved: threshold scalar binds; stack-wide characterization
- Killers at mu0>0 = first above-threshold level n_min = ceil(3mu0 boundary)
  (2/4/6 for mu0=3/5,6/5,9/5), scalar l=0 dominant; symbolic threshold curve
  a_{2,0}(r,w,mu0) derived, factors at mu0=2/3 as (3r+4)(3r+3w+1)/9.
- Analytic verdict vs ALL SIX mu0!=0 maps: 2 perfect; 30 discrepancies total,
  every one a predicted-doomed cell (dist 0.1 from edge, dies at n=10w+1);
  4 verified by direct deep evaluation incl. exact marginal zeros.
- Combined score: 11994 exact points across 7 maps + fine grid, zero true
  mismatches. The island is now analytically characterized across the stack
  (conjectural completeness caveat unchanged; domain-critic review running).

## 2026-08-13 — External control passed: Mansfield-Spradlin agree on the edge at w=0
- Their Theorem 11 (contour asymptotics, w=0): odd-Delta Regge coefficient sign
  ruled by (2r+m^2+1) -> critical line r=-(1+m^2)/2 = our edge -(1+mu0)/2.
  Different method, same line. Our law is exact per-n and covers w!=0 (novel).

## 2026-08-13 — Island Atlas visual
- article/visuals/qg-island-atlas.png: seven mu0 islands, one analytic edge law
  -(1+mu0)/2 overlaid; mu0<=0 islands hug the line, mu0>0 gap = threshold scalar.

## 2026-08-13 — Independent review PASSED; all 7 fixes applied
- Domain-critic verdict: NO algebraic error in the three closed forms; a_{n,n-2}
  bracket upgraded to proven-for-all-n (reviewer's polynomial identity,
  C(n)=24(2n-1)/(n-1)). Adversarial script (6 attacks incl. route1-vs-route2 at
  mu0!=0 and below-threshold sanity) executed: SURVIVED, exit 0. Script archived
  as lab/attack_left_edge.py.
- Fixes applied: domain defined explicitly; n=3mu0 identical-zero edge case
  stated; "true left edge" reworded to exclusion-direction-only; caps header ->
  "conjectured"; redundant r=-1/2,w<0 clause resolved via n=1 block (6 exact
  sample points).
- Card A core status: analytic laws INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED + adversarially
  survived; completeness of the characterization remains a labeled conjecture.

## 2026-08-13 — Stage-closure cinematic THE ISLAND delivered
- 40 s Godot film (NOVA/viz/island.gd, art-bible style): every plate = real
  allowed (r,w) point (655 coarse + 1145 fine), yellow wall = theorem edge
  r=-1/2, 176 pink crystals = theorem-killed points sinking, probe scans the
  rim. Music Truthfall 0.08 + space rumble at the execution. QC: 6 frames from
  the FINAL mp4 inspected. Copy: article/visuals/qg-the-island-cinematic.mp4.
- Ops lesson archived in reality-production skill: MovieMaker PNG has alpha=0
  on BG pixels; viewers render it white — phantom "white sky" (30 min bisect).

## 2026-08-13 night — Left edge is dimension-universal
- sign(a_{n,n-1}) = sign(n(r+(1+mu0)/2)+w) for all D>3 (x^{n-1} coefficient is
  D-free; Gegenbauer norm positive). 10/10 checks incl. 4 exact zeros at D=6,10.
- The island shrinks with D, but its left edge stays pinned at -(1+mu0)/2.

## 2026-08-13 night N1 — a_{n,n-3} closed form derived and verified
- Ratio to brute force = positive constant for n=4..9 at random (r,w).
- Leading n^3(2r+1): fourth trajectory asymptotically safe for r>-1/2 —
  another brick under the completeness conjecture.
- Video paused by founder; captions switch to ENGLISH on resume.

## 2026-08-13 night N2 (numeric part) — fixed-spin tails clean to n=100
- 10 island points (incl. on-edge r=-1/2 and near-hyperbola): a_{n,l} > 0 for
  l=0..3 at n=10..100, exact arithmetic. Both excluded controls show negatives
  (control valid). Artifact: results/n2_fixed_spin.json.
- New structural note: beyond the edge (r=-3/5) fixed-spin coefficients also
  turn negative at large n (l=1,3 from n=50) — the edge is witnessed at fixed
  spin, not only on the l=n-1 ladder. To derive analytically next.

## 2026-08-13 night N2 (analytic part, in progress)
- Localization at x=1 gives fixed-spin law a_{n,l} ~ (2l+1) * C(r,w)/(n ln n),
  C > 0 in the domain (heuristic derivation; leading order w-free, C ~ 1/(1+r)
  up to a Gamma-ratio integral). Numeric: (2l+1) scaling exact (l=0 vs l=2
  ratios coincide to 3 digits); measured C at 4 points positive, drifting
  logarithmically (0.27..0.86 at n=200). Exact constant + rigor = morning task.
- Implication: fixed-spin family asymptotically safe across the domain —
  completeness conjecture now supported on ALL asymptotic families
  (l=n-1, n-2, n-3 exact; fixed-l asymptotic).

## 2026-08-14 night N3 — D-dependence of binding curves in closed form
- a_{1,0}: D-independent; a_{2,0}: (1+r)(r+w) >= -1/(D-1); a_{3,0}: closed form
  with 1/(D-1) coefficients. D=4 limits reproduce all verified curves exactly.
- Explains analytically why the island shrinks with D while the left edge is
  pinned at -(1+mu0)/2.

## 2026-08-14 night N4 — paper skeleton drafted
- article/qg-island-draft.md: title, abstract, 9-claim status table (honest),
  section plan, figure list, limitations, repro pack. Morning review target.

## 2026-08-14 morning — Comic video delivered (N6)
- article/visuals/comic/comic_island.mp4: 33 s, 8 panels, EN captions, black
  outlines + halftone comic system (panel_style.css reusable), real data in
  every panel (atlas, edge map, MS match, 11994/0 stats). Music Truthfall ->
  Civilize, boom on finale. QC frames from final mp4 inspected.
- Night loop incident: no wakeups fired 00:15-08:16 (machine/app sleep
  suspected); N5 (q-deformation) carried to today.

## 2026-08-14 — Odd/even trajectory dichotomy at the edge
- k=1..7: odd trajectories kill beyond the edge (finite thresholds, predicted
  by our brackets and confirmed exactly: k=3 at n=57, k=1 w=1.7 at n=85);
  even trajectories positive on both sides. Edge witnessed by an infinite
  constraint family. Initial "failures" were finite-threshold effects — now
  quantitatively explained, no contradictions.

## 2026-08-14 — Video abstract for the paper delivered
- article/visuals/vabstract/video_abstract.mp4: 66 s, 1920x1080, academic
  style (7 slides: setting, edge theorem + prediction table, erosion + 176
  corrections, boundary algebra, cross-checks, honest status + repro links).
  Quiet bed, slow fades. QC frames from final mp4 inspected.

## 2026-08-14 N5 — the q-clock: n_crit ~ 1.1/sqrt(q-1)
- q-Veneziano exclusion depth measured exactly for six q values; exponent -1/2
  stable; q=1 control clean. Explains finite-depth scans admitting small q-1.
  New beyond the anchor paper (they had q>1 asymptotic-only).

## 2026-08-14 — q-clock exponent -1/2 mechanically derived
- g(n) = -dlog a_{n,0}/dq |_{q=1} ~ 0.3 n^2 (exact finite difference h=1e-6);
  eps*n^2 ~ 1 crossing reproduces the measured exponent; first-order constant
  1.8 vs measured 1.1 (higher orders kill sooner).

## 2026-08-14 — Big-idea concept video delivered
- article/visuals/qg-island-bigidea.mp4 (35 s, EN): black hole (EHT shader) ->
  "which string theory?" -> landscape slice -> consistency wave sinks bad tiles
  -> glowing edge + formula -> "our piece of the big puzzle". QC 6 frames from
  final mp4. Scenes: NOVA/viz/bh_intro.gd + island_mini.gd (reusable).

## 2026-08-14 — Preprint main.tex written (full draft v1)
- projects/qg-bootstrap/paper/main.tex: complete LaTeX (abstract, setup, edge
  theorem with proof sketch, trajectory laws + dichotomy, island
  characterization as labeled Conjecture, threshold + D-dependence, q-clock
  section, Mansfield-Spradlin relation, honest discussion, AI disclosure,
  repro section). MiKTeX installing for local compile QC.

## 2026-08-14 — Big-idea video v2 (BH -> particle collision -> map), 41 s
- New collide_beat.gd (two particles -> flash: the S-matrix as "the sharpest
  test"); captions rewritten for lay accuracy (probabilities-never-negative =
  positivity; PROVED refers to the exclusion direction which is proven).
- Paper compiled: main.pdf, 5 pages (MiKTeX). Next: internal validation.

## 2026-08-14 — Validation battery round 1 + fixes; story videos RU/EN
- Independent validator (fresh code, no lab imports): PASS 5/5 (razor, a_{2,0}
  law, nine casualties, q-clock spots, D=6 zero).
- Release review: 6 blockers found and ALL FIXED in main.tex v2: correct CHR
  title (PRL 133, 251601), abstract reworded to exclusion-only + mu0>0 caveat,
  novelty scoped to INSPIRE-citing works, repo link removed pending release
  package, n=200 wording matched to artifacts, "unexplained" mismatches,
  finite-difference wording; figures added (atlas + edge map). 6 pages.
- artifacts_battery.py persists all paper-cited computations (census, stack
  11994, dichotomy, q-clock + derivative, D checks, fixed-spin) -> re-running
  after JSON-serialization fix.
- Story videos RU + EN (48 s: BH -> vibrating string -> collision -> map ->
  edge): delivered; frozen-tail bug in batch renders diagnosed (single renders
  fine), segments re-rendered individually, QC of final mp4 tails passed.

## 2026-08-14 — PUBLISHED: qg-island-edges v1.0.0
- github.com/AndreiPLK/qg-island-edges public (repo/release/PDF all verified
  reachable without login, HTTP 200). Founder approved; push executed with his
  explicit authorization after his Run attempts failed. Zenodo DOI pending the
  founder's toggle; then v1.0.1 re-release mints DOI -> final PDF update.

## 2026-08-14 — Portfolio updated and live
- andreiplk.github.io: new work card + one-pager works/qg-island-edges/ with
  paper.pdf and edge map; visibility verified (page 200, paper 200, 5 mentions
  on the front page). Placement checklist vs project 1: GitHub+release+web
  paper+portfolio DONE; Zenodo DOI pending founder toggle; arXiv planned via
  endorsement.

## 2026-08-14 — DOI MINTED: 10.5281/zenodo.21934462
- Zenodo toggle (founder) -> release v1.0.1 -> DOI. Final PDF with DOI in
  author footnote + repro section; pushed to repo and site; DOI badge in
  README, DOI buttons on portfolio. CHR letter draft updated with final links
  (site PDF, repo, DOI); awaiting founder's Send.

## 2026-08-14 — CHR letter SENT by founder; publication stage CLOSED
- Letter (short, human tone) to Cheung cc Remmen with paper/repo/DOI links and
  endorsement request; forward-to-Hillman asked. EV-CORR-0002.
- Stage totals: theorems reviewed+attacked+validated; repo+release v1.0.1;
  DOI 10.5281/zenodo.21934462; site with 'Explain it to anyone' section and
  site-wide readability fix (dark link contrast verified programmatically);
  two outreach letters live (Hirst thread + CHR).
- Next: await replies (CHR endorsement -> arXiv submission); science resumes
  with Card B and the gravity direction (CHR open problem O3).

## 2026-08-14 — GRAVITY SLICE 1 STARTED: the D-clock of Virasoro-Shapiro
- Scientist playbook (12 steps + house methods) saved to permanent memory per
  founder's order; North Star confirmed (are gravitational amplitudes forced
  to be string-like?).
- VS residues derived exactly: R_n(t) = [prod_{k=1}^{n-1}(t+k)]^2 / const —
  double zeros confirmed (CHR O3 gateway).
- First scan: positivity clean to n=16 for D=4..20; D=26 breaks at (n,l)=(3,2).
  The critical dimension D=10 must emerge at depth — a D-clock, mirroring our
  q-clock. Deep scan to n=40 running (lab/vs_d_clock.py).

## 2026-08-14 — VS D-clock deep scan: a CLIFF, not a clock
- D=12..22: positivity clean to n=40. D=24: first negative (4,4); D=26,28,30:
  (3,2). Sharp transition between D=22 and 24 — near the bosonic critical
  dimension 26, NOT a smooth n_crit(D) divergence. Either the true positivity
  bound for massless VS sits at ~23, or the transition is cliff-like.
  Artifact: results/vs_d_clock.json. Literature check + deeper D=22 scan next.

## 2026-08-14 — Novelty radar on the gravity slice (worked as designed)
- Our VS D-cliff reproduces KNOWN physics: arXiv:2210.14920 maps D_crit(n)
  from ~26 (low n) to 10 (n->infinity). Method validated on the gravity side;
  no novelty claim made (playbook step 2 saved us again).
- Found 'Uniqueness criteria for the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude' — possibly
  the CHR program already done for VS. MUST read before freezing the gravity
  card. Next: deep-read that + 2210.14920, then freeze our unique slice
  (candidate: the deformation-FAMILY island of VS analogs via our
  top-coefficient machinery — the analog of our w!=0 niche).

## 2026-08-14 — GRAVITY CARD FROZEN: exact edge of the closed-string island
- Deep-read 2408.03362 (CHR did O3 themselves!): one-parameter lambda-family
  of VS deformations, residues are perfect squares, D>=9 positivity bounds
  lambda from below -- NUMERICALLY, finite depth, no closed form. Our frozen
  question: lambda_min(D) exactly via top-coefficient method (a_{n,2n-4} law,
  odd trajectories vanish), + erosion clock, + lambda=1 VS cross-check.
- Novelty radar: 37 citing works enumerated; adjacent art flagged (2607.27300
  hidden-zeros analytic bounds -- abstract does not treat the lambda-family;
  full-text verification required before any novelty claim).
- Card: research/gravity-card.md (metric frozen before computing).

## 2026-08-14 — GRAVITY SLICE 1: edge law of the closed-string island DERIVED
- sign a_{n,2n-4} = sign[q_n(lambda) D + p_n(lambda)] with explicit quadratics;
  exact rho(l,D)=(l+1)(l+2)/(2(D+2l-1)). VS thresholds D_n=24,23,24,51/2,136/5
  (min 23 at n=4) EXPLAIN our measured D-cliff to the unit; razor zero D*=45
  at lambda=2 confirmed (+/- bracketing at 44/46). Dangerous lambda-window
  shrinks to pure VS like ~1.1/n. Note: research/gravity-card.md.

## 2026-08-14 — Gravity slice 2: VS threshold in closed form
- D_n(1) = 2(n^2+4n-9)/(n-2), verified 10/10 for n=3..12; min = 23 at n=4.
  The D-cliff of pure closed-string gravity is now a formula. lambda-windows
  for n=3..12 computed exactly.

## 2026-08-14 — Gravity slice 3: alternatives SURVIVE in D=4
- Lemma: near-leading bracket positive-definite at D=4 for all lambda (10/10
  discriminants negative). Exact scan: 13 lambdas incl. corners 1/100, 100 —
  clean, l<=8, depth 60. Headline forming: string uniqueness is
  dimension-graded (free in 4D, forced in high D on these trajectories).

## 2026-08-14 — Gravity slice 4: exclusion map + honest correction
- Exact exclusion belts per D (n<=16): empty for D<=20; [1.03,1.53] at D=22;
  swallows lambda=1 at D=24; widens to [0.81,1.95] at D=40. Extremes survive
  this trajectory. CORRECTED earlier "squeeze toward the string" claim: the
  belt kills the string's NEIGHBORHOOD (and VS itself for D>=24); small-lambda
  corner is killed separately by low-spin constraints (CHR, D>=9).

## 2026-08-14 — BUG FOUND & OWNED: gravity-family Pochhammer step
- ((1+lam)/2+lam*t)_{n-1} increments by 1; my evaluator incremented by lam.
  At lam=1 both coincide -> all VS (lam=1) results REMAIN VALID (D-cliff,
  D_n(1) formula checks at lam=1). All lam != 1 claims (windows, belts, D=4
  lemma/scans, razor at lam=2) are VOID and being recomputed. Found while
  chasing a contradiction with CHR's "D>=9 bounds lambda from below" (my
  small-lambda scans were clean — too clean). Lesson: razor tests that share
  the evaluator with the bracket are circular; independent check caught it.

## 2026-08-14 — Gravity slices corrected: lambda_min(D) in closed form
- Corrected law: positivity <=> D <= T_n(lambda) (quadratics listed in card);
  T_3(0)=9 explains CHR's D>=9 onset; lambda_min(10)=0.0816 matches scanner
  bracket; VS D_n(1) formula unaffected. Buggy belt claims voided.

## 2026-08-14 — Gravity slice 5: lambda_min(D) exact; lambda_min(23)=1
- Single curve: onset D=9 at lambda=0; exact surd values; reaches the string
  exactly at D=23; beyond it for D>=24. n=3->n=4 dominance switch at D~18.

## 2026-08-14 — M2 main frame delivered: THE FATE CURVE
- article/visuals/qg-fate-curve.png: exact lambda_min(D) curve, dead zone,
  string line, magic point (23,1), our-world marker. Lesson delivered (below).

## 2026-08-14 — THE CONTINENT: full body drawn, analytic shore matches
- grav_full_body.json: 560 exact verdicts (lambda 0.05..2 x D 4..30, all even
  spins, depth 14). D<=8 fully alive (40/40); erosion from below as D grows
  (12/40 at D=30). Analytic shore lambda_min(D) traces the frontier; string
  drowns past D=23 as predicted. Visual: qg-continent.png. Founder's question
  "can we draw the full object?" answered: yes — this is it.

## 2026-08-14 — Zoom-out: the whole creature
- grav_zoomout.json (lambda 0.05..10, D 4..60, depth 12): the body is an OPEN
  WEDGE — for every D there survive sufficiently string-y candidates
  (lambda above the shore); the dead mouth widens with D; the string lane
  drowns past 23. Visual: qg-zoomout.png. Doctrine elevated: memorize+improve
  at every step = the main development thread (iteration-doctrine).

## 2026-08-14 — GENERAL LAW: T_n closed form + straight asymptote
- T_n = 3(2n-3)/(n(n-2))(lambda^2+(2n-2)lambda+1)+2n, verified 12/12;
  true shore (n<=400): lambda_min(23)=1 survives; asymptote D=(12+4sqrt3)lambda
  (n* = sqrt(3) lambda). The unfinished-figure question is answered exactly.

## 2026-08-15 night — Complete-model battery: 494/494, zero alarms
- alive <=> D <= min_n T_n matched every exact verdict; executions confirmed.

## 2026-08-15 night — Gravity review round CLOSED
- Claims 1-3 independently re-derived and strengthened; attack script: NO
  FALSIFICATION (0 failures, 4.3 s); fixes F1-F2 applied; completeness stays
  a labeled conjecture with a designated next hunt (a_{n,2n-6}).

## 2026-08-15 — THE BODY: full 3D island assembled from the 7 mu0 slices
- 9583 exact voxels (r, w, mu0) -> isosurface body; the slanted top facet is
  the -(1+mu0)/2 edge tilting with mass shift. Visual: island-body-3d.png.
  Founder's intuition "we hold edges of a full figure" rendered literally.
- Night rules v2 recorded (batch nights, always-background); fast 2n-6 hunt
  running (completeness test of the gravity model).

## 2026-08-15 — 2n-6 hunt: zero alarms; completeness conjecture strengthened

## 2026-08-15 — Pop-science key insight visual delivered
- string-inside-vs-edge.png: two-panel "inside vs on-the-wall" — the core
  meaning of both papers in one glance (gravity is the stricter judge).
  Yellow diamond visibility issue in the 3D bow noted (opaque body) — cutaway
  version queued.
